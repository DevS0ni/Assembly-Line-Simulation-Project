# Assembly Line Simulation Project

*Project Overview:*
```
Developed a C++ simulation of an assembly line with multiple stations for processing customer orders. 
The project demonstrates proficiency in object-oriented programming and modular design.
```

*TechStack Used:*
C++

*Achievements:*
```
~ Implemented Utilities for parsing input files and managing display formatting.
~ Created Station class for representing assembly line stations.
~ Developed CustomerOrder module to manage individual customer orders and item filling.
~ Ensured restricted copy and move operations for CustomerOrder objects.
~ Implemented Workstation class to represent active stations and fill customer orders.
~ Designed LineManager to configure and manage the assembly line.
```

*Skills Demonstrated:*
```
~ C++ programming and object-oriented design.
~ File parsing and data management.
~ Dynamic memory allocation and resource management.
~ Implementation of modular and interconnected classes.
```

*Future Enhancements:*
```
~ GUI implementation for interactive user experience.
~ Additional features like order prioritization and real-time status updates.
~ Exploring parallel processing for assembly line optimization.
```

*How to Play:*
```
~ Download this repo and open it with any IDE software - *Visual Studio*
~ Compile and run the executable.
~ Configure input files for station linkages.
~ Monitor the simulation progress in the console.
```

~ This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement complex systems using C++ and showcases my skills in software development and problem-solving.
